                    FOSDEM 2021 is not going to be the same as FOSDEM 2020 but we still wish to provide free and open
                    source
                    projects the opportunity to display their work and interact with the wider free and open source
                    community.

                    As this edition is completely different from the ones before, the stands process has undergone some
                    changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer you:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A position on a special stands website (active during the event) for you to introduce your
                        project.
                        We will organise the stands per theme.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hosting for several short videos related to your stand where you can introduce your stand and
                        discuss some important topics.
                    </li>
                    <li>Two chatrooms per stand, with possibility to do private chat. One is intended for the “hallway
                        track”, the other is for meeting the developers or team behind the stand.
                    </li>
                    <li>A booklet with all stands, their introduction and a short description of “what’s new for your
                        project this year”.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    To get this organised, we'll require some extra information from you in your submission, and
                    possible
                    also during the preparation of the conference. More specifically, you'll have to provide:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An introduction (aim for around 10 lines) of your project.</li>
                    <li>An overview (aim for around 15 lines) of the "hot new thing" in your project, or what we can
                        expect
                        from you next year.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Both of these will be used for the booklet and the overview page of the website. You'll still be
                    able to
                    write whatever you like in your corner of the website, this is only intended for the overview and
                    table
                    of contents.
